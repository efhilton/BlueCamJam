# BlueCamJam
A bluetooth enabled Raspberry Pi Robot!

## Introduction
This project adds motor control via bluetooth to a default Cam Jam EduKit Raspberry Pi robot. It sets up the robot as a slave, which can then be controlled remotely to do the following.

- Turn Right
- Turn Left
- Go Forward
- Go Backward
- Stop
- Beep - You need to have an audio output card or pair a bluetooth device to your robot.  In my case, I paired a tiny, thumb-sized bluetooth speaker to the robot. 
- Follow a sequence of preprogrammed commands - In this case a long sequence of commands is sent to the robot via Bluetooth, and the robot will interpret them one after the next. 

I presently have plans to add callbacks (eg. so that I can notify the Master of collision events). But like all good hobbies, I'll add that ... someday. Stay tuned.

This project was created so that I can teach my daughter how to program using either Thunkable or MIT App Inventor.  The idea is to have her use Scratch from her tablet to program this robot.
